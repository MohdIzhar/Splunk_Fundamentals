-> SPLUNK SEARCH MODES

* FAST MODE - REPRESENTED IN LIGHTNING SYMBOL
* SMART MODE - REPRESENTED IN CIRCULAR SYMBOL
* VERBOSE MODE - REPRESENTED IN SOUND SYMBOL

-> FIELD OPERATORS 

* used for analysing result
* common functions are - WILDCARDS, BOOLEANS AND COMPARISION OPERATORS

# OPERATORS

- field = value
- field != value
- field < value
- field > value
- field <= value
- field => value

# BOOLEAN

- field NOT value
- field = value1 OR field = value2 
- field = value1 AND field = value2 

# WILDCARDS

- field = "value*"

-> FIELD SIDEBAR

* located on left portion of splunk search, pulls selected and ineterested fields for quick search results
* Texted field denoted with a i.e alpha
  Numeric field with #

-> SPLUNK RESULT FIELDS

* events displayed
* formatting, per event
* ADD, EXCLUDE, NEW

-> SPL QUERIES

* SEARCH PROCESSING LANGUAGE
* uses the pipe to chain search commands
* index="airbnb" Neighbourhood=Halmer room_type="private_room" | command <argument>
* SPL Keywords - AS, BY, OVER, WHERE
  EX: index="airbnb" | where price > 40
* SPL filtering and modifying results 
  Fields - allows to add or remove 
  Search - allows to searching the raw text while using chaining command
  Dedup - removes the duplicate fields from the search results
  Rename - allows for field names to be changed in search results
* Ordering search result :-
  Head - returns top 10 results
  Tail - returns last 10 results
  Sort - sorting in ascending order
  Reverse - put search result in reverse order
  Tables - SPL cmd for creating table with specific field

# TRANSFORMING COMMANDS

* TOP cmd - returns the frequent value for the defaulted top 10 results
* RARE cmd - returns the least value for the defaulted top 10 results
* HIGHTLIGHT cmd - shows result in raw events mode with fields highlighted
* CONTINGENCY cmd - shows associations between fields in table

# STATS COMMANDS

* special type of transformming commands primarily used for calculation to for table results
  STATS avg([fieldname]) - calculate average 
  STATS count(eval[fieldname]) as newname - returns timeseries cart over the data element 
  STATS max(fieldname) - returns maximum values
  STATS min(fieldname)- returns minmum value
  STATS sum(fieldname) - returns of specific field

# CHARTS COMMANDS

* type of transformation commands for presenting data in tables or visualization.
* typically includes stats commands
   chart somefunction([fieldname])
   timechart somefunction([fieldname])
